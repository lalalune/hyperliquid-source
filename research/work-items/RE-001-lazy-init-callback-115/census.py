"""Census for the node #115 lazy-init 0x605e860 and its callback
0x606a110.

Scans the whole .text section (file range 0x1418300+0x4fd7700, vaddr
base 0x1419300) for direct e8 calls and e9 tail jumps to each window,
for 8-byte little-endian occurrences of each window start in .text,
and scans .rela.dyn/.rela.plt for RELATIVE addends equal to each
window start. Also scans the whole file for 8-byte little-endian
occurrences of each window start (vtable/data references). Uses
bytes.find (C speed) rather than a per-byte Python loop. Prints a
JSON summary to stdout.

Every hit must still be confirmed as a real call by reading its
containing function from its FDE start: the hit to 0x606a110 is the
e8 call at 0x605e893 inside the lazy-init; the hits to 0x605e860 are
the e8 calls at 0x5f14117 (in the sibling drain driver 0x5f140c0,
mapped by #2244) and at 0x605e8e0 (in the two-flag variant
0x605e8a0, mapped by #2259).
