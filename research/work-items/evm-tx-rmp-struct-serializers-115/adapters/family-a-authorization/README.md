# Family-a authorization-list key adapter

Component `evm`; subordinate to the existing evm-tx-rmp-struct-serializers-115 evidence.
Target node #115 SHA-256
`a6e2897cd051213d004802deca416e8eca62b7a8278fa39f249e98c3867b5301`;
base `0781ce04826eeefd89fe336cb8ea073be0c1de30`.
Actual FDE `0x2339e80..0x2339f48`: 200 bytes / 55 instructions.

## Observed local contract

Resolve the extra +0x90 delegate in the inline Eip7702-shaped payload. Mode exactly 1 emits b1 plus authorizationList from a pinned 16-byte constant and final t store. Other modes skip the local key/frame path. Both paths tail to the same collection encoder recorded in the exports, preserving original output/buffer/collection convention. The literal resolves the field name but not the authorization tuple, signature or validation semantics.

Buffer capacity/storage/length are +0/+8/+0x10. Local growth paths call the
recorded family-specific helper with marker/name lengths, reload descriptor
fields and rejoin the pending stores. All direct external edges are explicitly
pinned to actual FDE starts. Callees are boundaries, not newly recovered by
this adapter. No byte normalization or runtime type-name equivalence is used.

Python, Capstone 5.0.6, pyelftools 0.32. Full target digest/FDE, complete
decoding, instruction/data pins and branch destinations checked. 8 operative
mutations must reject below the image SHA guard. Independent finite controls
are recorded in records.json; they are not captured-instruction execution or
interpretation. Complete bytes, FDE/CIE, calls, branches and pool context retained.

Valid stable nonaliasing storage, buffer invariants and normal helper returns
are assumptions. Nested wire schemas, allocation failure, unwind behavior and
full native GNU/Rust/Ghidra/source reproduction remain unqualified. No progress
gate changes. Next: recover the named tail encoder rather than infer its body.
