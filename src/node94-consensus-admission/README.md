# Node #94 consensus block admission

This safe Rust crate reconstructs the bounded block-admission contract retained
in `research/work-items/RE-008-block-admission-94/` for node #94. It is an
in-memory component, not a networked consensus node. The captured executable is
never run.

## Target and evidence

- Target: `artifacts/node/94/hl-node`
- SHA-256: `3b7179cd967d1b13b683e05debfc685ad4c750e918226402d5d575eff1c0459f`
- Primary entry: `0x44b8410..0x44b95a0`
- Certificate helpers: QC `0x4758d70`, TC `0x47594f0`, timeout vote
  `0x454aa10`, strict quorum `0x4ad90d0`, stake lookup `0x42c9930`
- Retained qualification: 15 bounded functions, 22 block rows, 29 QC/TC rows,
  and 456 target-row-versus-spec cases

The integration tests bind the Rust error tags, native boundaries, gate text,
and case families to that immutable packet. They also mutate strictness, tie,
and ordering claims and require the altered contracts to fail.

## Implemented contract

`StakeHistory::snapshot_for` applies the saturating base-plus-2000 threshold,
the 200-round lag, and the last-key-at-or-before lookup. Quorum deduplicates
sorted addresses, ignores unknown weight, checks both `u64` sums, then compares
the full products with `3 * signed > 2 * total` in `u128`.

`verify_qc` preserves signer membership, signature, quorum, hardfork-pair,
start-round, and empty-genesis precedence. The target's stake-overflow and
newer-hardfork panic classifications are surfaced as `VerificationFailure::Fatal`
instead of crashing the embedding process.

`verify_tc` checks snapshot availability, nonempty votes, vote rounds, the
last highest-QC vote, that QC, every timeout signature, and strict voter
quorum. The target dispatches the final signature checks through a parallel
helper. The evidence establishes single-error results but not precedence among
several simultaneous invalid votes; this crate uses stable input order for that
unresolved case.

`verify_block` keeps stake selection, proposer selection, proposer identity,
QC, QC-round, optional TC, proposer membership, and proposer signature in the
recovered order. A `VerifiedBlock` cannot be constructed directly.

`admit_verified_block` applies committed-round, duplicate-hash, and
duplicate-round gates and returns a separate `AdmittedBlock`. Registration then
removes the tag-zero request row, writes unknown-transaction placeholders,
attempts optional forwarding, handles a closed channel without losing the
block, and inserts the block map row. `admit_and_register` does not mutate
`ConsensusState` on any verification or admission failure. Registration
revalidates state gates so a stale admitted token cannot overwrite intervening
state.

## Retained request rows

`request_throttle::RequestThrottle` implements the separately bounded tag-one
request-row operation from `RE-008-request-throttle-94`: exact round/hash keys,
original timestamps, reason-set union before suppression, and one-shot emission
at or after the computed deadline. It owns supplied state and returns values;
it does not send requests or implement the native log/lock helpers. This map is
separate from the tag-zero removal context in `ConsensusState`.

Delay bits use integer binary64 rounding followed by the captured nonfinite
product-to-zero and signed saturation rules. Canonical Gregorian timestamp
validation and deadline range refusal are explicit safe policies; range refusal
preserves registration/reason changes. Rust allocation must succeed, with no
rollback or native allocation/exception equivalence promised. The packet's
CONTRACT, PROOF and additive source-validation/SOURCE-PROOF state the limits.

The focused qualification selects `cargo test --lib` and
`cargo test --test request_throttle`, in debug and release, offline and locked.
The existing `evidence_contract` target and broad repository verification are
outside this operation's source qualification.

## Authentication boundary

The following native behavior remains unresolved in the retained evidence:

- proposer scheduling at `0x4b31e70`;
- block/QC/timeout digest construction at `0x454c050`;
- signature recovery at `0x14c6f50`.

`AdmissionAuthenticator` isolates those operations. It receives typed signing
fields and opaque signatures and returns recovered validator identities, which
this crate compares with the claimed addresses and selected stake set. No API
accepts a caller's `is_valid` boolean. This boundary is not a claim of
end-to-end cryptographic verification. An embedding implementation must
authenticate the supplied block identity consistently with its recovered
digest implementation.

The crate also does not implement networking, proposal construction, commit
walking, transaction execution, persistence, timers, or the already-existing
timeout-transition component.
